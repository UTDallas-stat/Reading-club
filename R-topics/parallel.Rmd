This document gives a brief introduction to one of `R`'s most useful standard packages -- the `parallel` package.


**Motivating example

Lets start with a motivating example.
Suppose we want to find the number of primes between **2 and 5,000,000** (inclusive).
A sensible approach would consists of the following steps:

  1. Write a function to detect if a given integer is a prime. 
  2. Apply the function in \#1 on all integer between 2 and 5,000,000.
  3. The total number of primes between 2 and 5,000,000 is the number of primes detected in step \#2. 
  
Here is a function that can be used to check if a given integer is a prime:
```{R}
is.prime <- function(n) ifelse(n == 2 || sum(!(n %% 1:ceiling(sqrt(n)))) == 1, TRUE, FALSE)
is.prime(2) ## 2 is a prime
is.prime(197) ## 197 is a prime
is.prime(19791) ## 19791 is not a prime
```

The following code gives the number of prime numbers between 2 and 5,000,000 while avoiding the use of `for` loops.
```{R}
system.time(print(sum(sapply(2:5e6, is.prime))))
```

**Parallel computing

By default, `R` handles loops sequentially. What it means is, `R` will compute the first task at hand and moves on to the next when the first is complete.
$$
\boxed{\mbox{Task 1}}\rightarrow\boxed{\mbox{Task 2}}\rightarrow\boxed{\mbox{Task 3}}\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow\boxed{\mbox{Task 10000}}
$$
There are `R` packages (e.g., `snow`, `multicore`, `parallel`, `Segue`, etc.) allow `R` 
to take advantage of multiple processes to compute tasks in a parallel fashion
$$
\left\{\begin{matrix}
\boxed{\mbox{Task 1}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 5}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 10}}& \cdots\\ \\
\boxed{\mbox{Task 2}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 7}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 8}}& \cdots \\ \\
\boxed{\mbox{Task 3}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 9}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 11}}& \cdots\\ \\
\boxed{\mbox{Task 4}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 6}}&\rightarrow& \boxed{\mbox{Task 16}}& \cdots
\end{matrix}\right.
$$
Of these packages in parallel computing, only the parallel package is a standard package, meaning you
can load the package without having to install it. 
```{R}
library(parallel)
```
The first step is to know how many CPU cores (clusters or workers) are available. 
This gives us an idea on how to divide the jobs
```{R}
detectCores()
```
This means I can assign jobs to up to `r detectCores()` clusters. 
To assign jobs, the following steps are needed:
  1. Define clusters
  2. Setup clusters
  3. Export functions/libraries to each cluster
  4. Assign jobs to each cluster
  5. Shut down clusters
The following codes give an example for the above prime example:
```{R}
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(detectCores())
setDefaultCluster(cl)
clusterExport(NULL, "is.prime")
system.time(print(sum(parSapply(NULL, 2:5e6, FUN = is.prime))))
stopCluster(cl)
```
Within the `parallel` environment, `sapply` is replaced with `parSapply`.
The `parallel` also offers functions like `parLapply` and `parApply` to replace with `lapply` and `apply`.

Note that the computing time with `parSapply` in this example is not
proportional to the computing time without.
The lost in computing time is due to the communication between processes.
A (possibly) more efficient way for our example is to submit a batch of jobs to each cluster.
For example:
```{R}
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(detectCores())
setDefaultCluster(cl)
clusterExport(NULL, "is.prime")
system.time(print(sum(parApply(NULL, matrix(1:5e6, 5e4), 1, FUN = function(x) sapply(x, is.prime))) - 1))
stopCluster(cl)
```
The first example assigns 5,000,000 jobs to `r detectCores()` clusters while
the second example assigns 50,000 jobs (each job has 100 numbers to compute) to `r detectCores()` clusters.

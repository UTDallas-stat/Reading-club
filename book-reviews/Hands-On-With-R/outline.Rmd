## Hands-On Programming with R

**WRITE YOUR OWN FUNCTIONS AND SIMULATIONS**

*By:*

*Garrett Grolemund*


## Using the functions in R is like riding a bus. Writing programs in R is like driving a car.


Using this analogy, programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things,
but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed.
R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a
kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the passenger seat, and mountain
climbing and spelunking gear in the back.

R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to learn how to use the equipment,
but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS.

## Projects

- Project 1: Weighted Dice
- Project 2: Playing Cards
- Project 3: Slot Machine


## Project 1: Weighted Dice

```{r, echo=TRUE}
roll <- function() {
 die <- 1:6
 dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
 sum(dice)}
roll()
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
roll2 <- function() {
 die <- 1:6
 dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE,
 prob = c(1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 3/8))
 sum(dice)}
roll2()
```

## Project 2: Playing Cards:

- R Objects:

 Design and build a virtual deck of playing cards

- R Notation

Write functions that deal and shuffle

- Modifying Values

 Change the point system to suit your game
 
 - Environments

 Manage the state of the deck

## R codes:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
deck <- read.csv("~/deck.csv")
shuffle <- function(cards) { random <- sample(1:52, size = 52)
 cards[random, ]}
deal <- function(cards) { cards[1, ]}
deck2 <- shuffle(deck)
deal(deck2)
facecard <- deck$face %in% c("king", "queen", "jack")
deck[facecard, ]
```
## Project 3: Slot Machine:

- Programs
- S3
- Loops
- Speed

## R codes

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
get_symbols <- function() {
 wheel <- c("DD", "7", "BBB", "BB", "B", "C", "0")
 sample(wheel, size = 3, replace = TRUE,
 prob = c(0.03, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.25, 0.01, 0.52))
}
get_symbols()
```

## Strategy:

1. Break complex tasks into simple sub-tasks.
2. Use concrete examples.
3. Describe your solutions in English, then convert them to R.

## score function:

```{r , echo = TRUE}
score <- function (symbols) {
 # identify case
 same <- symbols[1] == symbols[2] && symbols[2] == symbols[3]
 bars <- symbols %in% c("B", "BB", "BBB")
# get prize
 if (same) {
 payouts <- c("DD" = 100, "7" = 80, "BBB" = 40, "BB" = 25,
 "B" = 10, "C" = 10, "0" = 0)
 prize <- unname(payouts[symbols[1]])
 } else if (all(bars)) {
 prize <- 5
 } else {
 cherries <- sum(symbols == "C")
 prize <- c(0, 2, 5)[cherries + 1]
 }
# adjust for diamonds
 diamonds <- sum(symbols == "DD")
 prize * 2 ^ diamonds
}
 
 ```
 
  -----------------
```{r , echo = TRUE}
play <- function() {
 symbols <- get_symbols()
 print(symbols)
 score(symbols)
}

play()

```

##The S3 System:

S3 refers to a class system built into R. The system governs how R handles objects of
different classes. Certain R functions will look up an objectâ€™s S3 class, and then behave
differently in response.

## Loop:
Used to simulate slot machine plays by replication and calculate their payout.

rolls <- expand.grid(die, die)

- for (value in that) {
 this}

-while (condition) {
 code}

-repeat Loops


## Speed (using Vectorized Code):

Simulate 10 million plays of the slot machine!!

**How to increase the speed of your *for* loops:**

1-  If a line of code only needs to be run once, place it outside of the loop to avoid repetition

2-  make sure that any storage objects that you use with the loop are large enough to contain all of the results of the loop

## Pros & Cons:

Pros:

1- Easy language.

2- Illustrate basics.

3- Clear examples and examine the reader.

4- Used chart to explain steps.

5- Explained the fundamental of simulation and how to make it faster

Cons:

1- Few statistical graphs

2- Environment is not much useful

## Chapter 1
  - `.Call()` 
  - `SEXP` pointer to S expression type
  - `Rcpp::as<int>` converts the incoming argument from `SEXP` to integer.
  - `Rcpp::wrap()` converts the result to `SEXP` type returned by a function used with `.Call()`.
  - `inline` package provies complete wrappers for *compilation*, *linking*, and *loading* steps. 
    - `cxxfunction()` 
      - `sig` signature (input variables) of the function
      - `body` C++ codes to include/compiled; wrap with "`...`"
      - `plugin` Rcpp or others
      - `include` pure C++ function to pass through
  - `compiler` package compile regular `R` codes with `cmpfun` function.
      
## Chapter 2
  - To compile, link, and load:
    - `R CMD SHLIB` triggers `g++`
    - `dyn.load` to load the generated `.so` file
    - `.Call()` to call the `C/C++` file that's made available
  - `cxxfunction` with `rcpp` plugin reduce to `rcpp` function
  - Add `LinkingTo: Rcpp` in `DESCRIPTION` when including it in a package. 
  - Usage of `Rcpp` via `inline` is portable as `R` itself.
  - Adding `verbose=TRUE` in `cxxfunction` or `rcpp` shows both the temporary file created by `cxxfunction()` and the invocations by `R CMD SHLIB`. 
  - Use `include=` in `cxxfunction` to reduce the number of operator needed.

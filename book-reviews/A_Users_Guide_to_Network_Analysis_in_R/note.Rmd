## Chapter 2
    - Size: Number of nodes (vertices or actors). 
    - Ties: edges or relations connecting nodes
    - Density: Proportion of observed ties in a network to the maximum number of possible ties.
    - Directed network has directions; A to B is different than B to A
    - Directed network does not have directions; A to B is the same as B to A.
    - Components: subgroup in which all nodes are connected. 
    - Path: series of steps required to go from A to B in a network. 
    - Diameter: longest of the shortest paths (geodesics) across all pairs of nodes.
    - Measures the compactness or network efficiency. 
    - `sna::component.largest()`: 
      - `result = "membership"`: returns the logical vector indicating membership in a maximum component 
      - `result = "graph"`: returns the adjacency matrix (sociomatrix) of the subgraph induced 
      by the maximum component.
    - `sna::geodist()` calculates the shortest paths given adjacency matrix.
    -Transitivity: The proportion of closed triangles (triads where all three ties are observed) to 
    the total number of open and closed triangles (triads where two or three ties are observed).

## Chapter 3
  - Direct tie: arc
  - Nondirect tie: edge
  - Define a network object in `R` with an adjacency matrix or edge list with `network::network()`.
  - `network` class is compatible with `ggplot2`
  - `as.matrix` a `network` object after loading `statnet` gives the adjacency matrix.
  - `%v%` calls a vertices from a network
  - `%e%` calls an edge from a network
  - Network object can be created with `igraph::adjacency` or `igraph::edgelist`.
  - The `intergraph::asIgraph()` and `intergraph::asNetwork()` to go back and forth between `igraph` object and `network` object. 
  - Transforming a directed network to a non-directed network with `symmetrize()` a sociomatrix. 
    - `rule = "weak"`: A to B **or** B to A implies non-directed relationship.
    - `rule = "strong"`: A to B **and** B to A implies non-directed relationship.
    
## Chapter 4

  - Five guidelines of network layouts
    - Minimize edge crossings
    - Maximize the symmetry of the layout of nodes
    - Minimize the variability of the edge lengths
    - Maximize the angle between edges when they cross or join nodes
    - Minimize the total space used for the network display

## Chapter 5 \& 6
  
  - Illustrates `statnet::gplot`, `visNetwork`, `ggplot2`.
  
## Chapter 7
  
  - An actor is "prominent" if the ties of the actor make that actor visible to the other members in the network.
  - For non-directed networks, prominence is usually referred to as "centrality"
  - For directed networks, prominence is usually referred to as "prestige", a prestigious actor is one who is the object of extensive ties
  - (Popular) Measures of centrality: 
    - Degree centrality: The degree of a node is the number of ties it has with other nodes.
    - Closeness centrality: Nodes are more prominent to the extent they are close to 
    all other nodes in the network. Defines as the inverse of sum of the path distance.
    - Betweenness centrality: A node with high betweenness is prominent, then that node is in a position to
    observe or control the flow of information in the network. 
    - A "geodesic" is the shortest path between two node; betweeness centrality is the weighted average based on
    geodesics.
  - A "cutpoint" is defined as a node that, if dropped, would increase the number of components in the network.
  - Use `statnet::cutpoint()` to identify any cutpoints. 
  - "Bridges" are edge equivalent to cutpoints; an edge is a bridge if removing it will 
  split one component into two.
  
## Chapter 8
  - A subgroup in a network is a set of nodes that has a relatively large number of internal ties, 
  and also relatively few ties from the group to other parts of the network.
  - A "clique" is a maximally complete subgraph; it is a subset of nodes that have all possible ties among them. 
  - Typically, only cliques of size 3 or larger are of interest. 
  - `igraph::graph.formula` can be used to define network
  - A "k-core" is a maximal subgraph where each vertex is connected to at least k other vertices in the subgraph.
  - "Modularity" is a measure of the structure of the network, 
  specifically the extent to which nodes exhibit clustering where there is greater density within
  the clusters and less density between them. 
  - Modularity is used in an exploratory fashion. 
  - Modularity is a chance-corrected statistics, and is defined as the difference of the fraction of 
  ties that fall within the observed and exptected (under random tie H0).
  - The modularity statistic can range from -0.5 to 1; the closer to 1, the more the network 
  exhibits clustering with respect to the given node grouping. 
  - Table 8.2 gives a list of functions used to detect communities.

## Chapter 2
    - Size: Number of nodes (vertices or actors). 
    - Ties: edges or relations connecting nodes
    - Density: Proportion of observed ties in a network to the maximum number of possible ties.
    - Directed network has directions; A to B is different than B to A
    - Directed network does not have directions; A to B is the same as B to A.
    - Components: subgroup in which all nodes are connected. 
    - Path: series of steps required to go from A to B in a network. 
    - Diameter: longest of the shortest paths (geodesics) across all pairs of nodes.
    - Measures the compactness or network efficiency. 
    - `sna::component.largest()`: 
      - `result = "membership"`: returns the logical vector indicating membership in a maximum component 
      - `result = "graph"`: returns the adjacency matrix (sociomatrix) of the subgraph induced 
      by the maximum component.
    - `sna::geodist()` calculates the shortest paths given adjacency matrix.
    -Transitivity: The proportion of closed triangles (triads where all three ties are observed) to 
    the total number of open and closed triangles (triads where two or three ties are observed).

## Chapter 3
  - Direct tie: arc
  - Nondirect tie: edge
  - Define a network object in `R` with an adjacency matrix or edge list with `network::network()`.
  - `network` class is compatible with `ggplot2`
  - `as.matrix` a `network` object after loading `statnet` gives the adjacency matrix.
